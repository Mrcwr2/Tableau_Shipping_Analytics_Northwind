# Tableau_Shipping_Analytics_Northwind_Dashboard

### Objective:

Northwind Trade is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) all over the world.
The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis. 
He would like a dashboard of this where he selects a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be shipped.
Northwind Trade has a database on Azure as well as Maria DB. The Shipping manager has given us the details to connect to it.
